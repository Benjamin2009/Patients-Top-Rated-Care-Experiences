# Patients' Top-Rated Care Experiences (HCAHPS Survey Top Box Score)

### Overview
The **HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) Survey** is a national, standardized survey that captures hospital patients' experiences during recent inpatient stays.

It provides insights into patient satisfaction levels, survey response rates, and highlights where hospitals perform above or below the cohort average. The information is valuable for healthcare providers and policymakers to understand patient feedback and identify areas of excellence or improvement in care delivery. By comparing performance metrics, hospitals can tailor their strategies to enhance patient experience and satisfaction.
